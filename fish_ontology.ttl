This species is easily identified by its silver to golden base coloration with distinctive black vertical bars running along its body. Males are particularly striking during breeding season when they develop intense red coloration on their head and body. The fish has a laterally compressed, deep body shape with large prominent eyes and a small terminal mouth. It typically grows to a maximum size of 6.5 cm and inhabits forest streams with clear, fast-flowing water. The species is found in the Kalu, Kelani, and Mahaweli river basins across several districts including Kalutara, Colombo, and Kandy. Bulath Hapaya is classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN due to habitat destruction from mini-hydro projects and over-collection for the aquarium trade. It feeds primarily on filamentous algae and detritus, making it an important part of the forest stream ecosystem.".

The species inhabits small forest streams and tributaries in the Kelani, Mahaweli, and Kalu river basins. It can be found in districts including Colombo, Gampaha, and Kandy, often in protected areas like Sinharaja Forest Reserve and Peak Wilderness Sanctuary. Depulliya is threatened by habitat destruction and is classified as Endangered by the IUCN. The species is named 'Depulliya' (meaning 'two spots' in Sinhala) for its characteristic two black spots, which distinguish it from other barb species. It plays an important role in the forest stream ecosystem as a small but significant component of the aquatic food web.".

Males are more colorful with deeper bodies and develop intense red coloration on their body and fins during breeding season. The species typically grows to 4.5 cm and inhabits small forest streams with sandy bottoms in the Kalu, Bentota, and Gin river basins. It can be found in districts including Kalutara, Galle, and Matara, often in protected areas like Sinharaja Forest Reserve and Kanneliya Forest Reserve. Halamal Dandiya is threatened by habitat destruction from sand excavation and deforestation. The species is named for its pearly appearance ('Halamal' means 'pearly' in Sinhala) and is also known as the Pearly Rasbora or Fire Rasbora due to its striking coloration. It feeds on detritus and insects, playing an important role in the forest stream ecosystem.".

Females are typically silver with less intense coloration. The fish grows to a maximum size of 5.0 cm and inhabits forest streams and small rivers in the Kelani, Nilwala, and Kalu river basins. It can be found in districts including Colombo, Matara, and Kalutara, often in protected areas like Sinharaja Forest Reserve and Kanneliya Forest Reserve. Lethiththaya is threatened by hydroelectric projects, pollution, deforestation, and selective overexploitation for the ornamental fish trade. The species is particularly vulnerable because the most colorful individuals (males) are selectively removed from the wild, leading to genetic impoverishment. It plays an important role in the forest stream ecosystem and is highly valued in the aquarium trade for its striking appearance.".

    :speciesDescription "Thal Kossa (Belontia signata), also known as the Ceylonese Combtail, is a vulnerable freshwater fish endemic to Sri Lanka, distinguished by its comb-like caudal fin and filamentous extensions. This species has a laterally compressed, deep body with a brown to olive base coloration and dark vertical bars. Males are larger with more elaborate fin extensions and develop enhanced coloration during breeding season. The fish can grow up to 12.0 cm, making it one of the larger endemic species, and inhabits slow-moving forest streams and pools in the Kalu, Kelani, and Mahaweli river basins. It can be found in districts including Kalutara, Colombo, and Kandy, often in protected areas like Sinharaja Forest Reserve and Peak Wilderness Sanctuary. Thal Kossa is unique among the endemic species for its labyrinth organ, which allows it to breathe air and survive in poorly oxygenated water. The species is known for its aggressive behavior, especially in dominant males, and is territorial. It faces threats from habitat destruction and is classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN. The species is named 'Ceylonese Combtail' for its distinctive comb-like caudal fin with filamentous extensions.".
